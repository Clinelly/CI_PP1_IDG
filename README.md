## User Experience

### Target Audience 

### User Requrements and Expectations

### User Stories
The main service provided by IDG is a utility repair service. This means that there's some scope for expansion for the typical first-time/returning/frequent user stories. These could be expanded into emergency users, planned users, contracted users. These definitions are interchangeable and not mutually exclusive; a contracted user may be a first-time user but may actively be looking for similar key requirements that a frequent user would.
 
#### First Time Users / Emergency User
 
A first time user would be a user who is looking for utility work through a search engine and finds IDG's website, having never previously visited. An emergency user is someone who requires IDG's services in a time-sensitive manner. Therefore, their key requirements are:
 
1. To easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
2. To be easily able navigate throughout the site to find content.
3. To look for testimonials from other users and find out what they think of the service provider and see if they are trusted.
4. To locate their social media links to see the organisations' followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
5. To quickly and easily contact the service provider and utilise their services.
 
#### Returning Users / Planned User
 
A returning user is likely to be a user who has used IDG's services and is returning for further work. A planned user is a user who has carried out previous research into the services they require before finding IDG, or be someone who has had IDG reccommended to them. Their key requirements are:

6. To find information about additional services.
7. To find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
8. To find ideas and inspirations.
 
#### Frequent User / Contract User
 
A frequent user is someone who utilises IDG's services on a regular basis. A contracted user could be an organisation that works alongside IDG or has them on their books. Their key requirements would be:

9. To check to see if the gallery has been updated with new work.
10. To check to see if there are any new reviews.
11. To be informed if the service provider is continuing to trade.
