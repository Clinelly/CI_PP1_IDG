The ultimate goal of the project is to create a website for a small business and showcase their services; bringing them new customers and helping expand their business.

- Being able to see what services they provide.
- Being able to contact the tradesman quickly in case of an emergency.
- Being able to ask the business questions about prices. 
- Being able to see previous customer reviews and pictures of completed work.

### Site Owner Goals

- Being able to increase the number of customers.
- Being able to provide customers with an easy way to contact the business.
- Being able to explain to customers what services the business provides.
- Being able to show to customers what previous project have been completed.

## User Experience

### Target Audience 

- People who need a plumber/electrician in an emergency.
- People who are looking for a plumber/electrician to carry out routine or planned work.
- People who may be looking for inspiration or ideas for home improvements.
- Organisations who may be looking to contract a new tradesman.

### User Requrements and Expectations

### User Stories
The main service provided by IDG is a utility repair service. This means that there's some scope for expansion for the typical first-time/returning/frequent user stories. These could be expanded into emergency users, planned users, contracted users. These definitions are interchangeable and not mutually exclusive; a contracted user may be a first-time user but may actively be looking for similar key requirements that a frequent user would.
 
#### First Time Users / Emergency User
 
A first time user would be a user who is looking for utility work through a search engine and finds IDG's website, having never previously visited. An emergency user is someone who requires IDG's services in a time-sensitive manner. Therefore, their key requirements are:
 
1. To easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
2. To be easily able navigate throughout the site to find content.
3. To look for testimonials from other users and find out what they think of the service provider and see if they are trusted.
4. To locate their social media links to see the organisations' followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
5. To quickly and easily contact the service provider and utilise their services.
 
#### Returning Users / Planned User
 
A returning user is likely to be a user who has used IDG's services and is returning for further work. A planned user is a user who has carried out previous research into the services they require before finding IDG, or be someone who has had IDG reccommended to them. Their key requirements are:

6. To find information about additional services.
7. To find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
8. To find ideas and inspirations.
 
#### Frequent User / Contract User
 
A frequent user is someone who utilises IDG's services on a regular basis. A contracted user could be an organisation that works alongside IDG or has them on their books. Their key requirements would be:

9. To check to see if the gallery has been updated with new work.
10. To check to see if there are any new reviews.
11. To be informed if the service provider is continuing to trade.

## Design

### Design Choices

The website was designed around the idea of a utility service. A monochrome scheme was used to attempt to convey a sense of modern professionalism; the colour choices and geometric shapes focus on the utilitarian aspect of the business.

### Colour

- For the colour scheme, I wanted to convey a sense of professionalism and a link to the plumbing aspect of the business. I chose a monochrome scheme, centered around a light blue background, with darker grey colours providing contrast for borders and text.

![Colour Scheme](docs/features/IDG_main_scheme.png)

- During testing, it was found that the contrast between the text and background colours was not sharp enough; leading to accessibility problems. I put the main scheme back into the colour wheel and darkened it to provide a sharper text colour.

![Text Scheme](docs/features/IDG_text_scheme.png)

- Finally, I wanted the logo to 'pop' from the screen to catch the user's eye and highlight the electrical side of the business using contrasting, bright colours.

![Logo Scheme](docs/features/IDG_logo_scheme.png)

### Fonts

Roboto Slab was used for the headings and Roboto Condensed for the body. Sans Serif was chosen as a back-up font.
<br>
Roboto was chosen because it fit with the utilitarian asthetic of the website. Slab was used for the headings to provide greater definition over the Condensed body font.

### Structure

The website has a generic layout, used across the internet. This is to convey a sense of familiarity and prevent a frustrating user experience by having a complex, unfamiliar layout. The header contains the company logo in the top right of the screen, with a navigation bar in the top left. The main content is displayed in the main body in the centre of the screen. The footer is located at the bottom of the webpage and contains direct links to related external media.

The website has four pages:
- The Home page, which provides user with a basic outline about the company.
- The Services page, which goes into detail about what the company offers and what users can expect.
- The Gallery page, which provides users with images and pictures of what the company can provide and has accomplished in the past.
- The Contact page, which allows the user to provide their personal details and a detailed query to the company for a tailored response.

### Features to be Implemented

## Testing

### HTML Validation

The W3C Markup Validation Service was used to check the validity of the HTML used across the website.
A number of errors were flagged; however, these were recorded as part of the Facebook code for the embedded reviews. No errors were shown with regard to my custom HTML.
Two warnings were flagged:
 - Sections lacking headings. These sections were used to house images as a background and did not require headings.
 - ARIA-Label. An ARIA-Label was placed on the contact links in the footer for accessibilty.
