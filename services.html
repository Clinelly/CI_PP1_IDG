                            <p>Caused by frozen water or a broken seal, a burst pipe is a serious emergency. If left unchecked; hundreds of litres of water will flow non-stop into your home, causing substantial damage.
                            Water will get under your floors, soften the plaster and brickwork of your walls and damage your furniture and belongings. 
                            After the water flow has been cut off, the whole pipe will need to be replaced before it can be used safely again.
                            </p>

                        </summary>
                            <p>Leaks can be just as damaging as a burst pipe. Caused by damage to the pipe itself or a deterioration of the seals between pipe sections; water will slowly leak into your home. 
                            If the leak is located in the wall or ceiling cavity, or under the floor; the water damage could lead to structural issues.
                            Signs of a leaking pipe are often wet patches on your walls, ceilings or floors.

                            <p>As radiators get older, they become more inefficent; seals can leak, taps can rust into place and sludge can build up in the system. Improve your home's energy efficiency by having new and modern radiators installed.
                            Modern radiators can be up to 50% more efficient than their older. The increased efficiency leads to a decrease in energy bills.  
                            Modern radiators also channel water more efficiently, with more hot water coming into contact with more radiator surface space, whilst using much less water.  </p>

                            <p>Replacing your old boiler is a daunting prospect, however the benefits often far outweigh the costs. Modern boilers are much more efficient; providing more heat for less energy consumption, saving you money on your monthly bills.

                        Loose wires can spark and create a severe fire risk. Newer sockets are more durable and even have USB ports to charge your phones and tablets.

                        so it's a good idea to consult a qualified electrician to determine whether your electrical system is safe. A full safety report can be generated along with any recommendations and submitted to the homeowner.

                        Exterior lighting can add enjoyment to your outdoor areas as well as provide a layer of security in the night.

                        <p>A full or partial rewire of your home is a job for the professionals. The average lifespan of your electrical installation is 25 years; after that, you may start to see some electrical faults.
                        Light fittings may burn bulbs out regularly, sockets may be unreliable, you may notice an increase in your electrical bills and switches may stop working. A home rewire will solve all those problems,
                        increasing the safety and efficiency of your electrical systems for the future.
